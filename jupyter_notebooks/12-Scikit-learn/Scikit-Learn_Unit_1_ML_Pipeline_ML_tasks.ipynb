    "* When modelling, for supervised learning, you will typically use an overall workflow like:\n",
    "  * Split the dataset into train and test set\n",
    "  * Fit the model (either a pipeline or not) \n",
    "  * Evaluate your model. If performance is not good, revisit the process, starting from collecting the data, conducting EDA etc\n",

    "There are some potential small variations to this workflow, but this is the starting point we consider in your journey of modelling\n",
