    "* As you have seen, neural networks are constructed using a set of parameters and hyperparameters. Therefore, you will need to set them when designing your network.\n",
    "* The truth is that you don't know which arrangement will be the best for your dataset, considering the technical performance you want to meet and the time it takes to train your model. \n",
    "* This process of finding the best hyperparameter will typically involve a lot of trial and error. We presented in the previous unit a few guidelines and rules of thumb when designing a neural network that can also guide your criteria when optimizing your neural network's hyperparameters. \n",
